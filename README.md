- [DevelopmentChallengeServerApp] - Itâ€™s the naming server or service registry.
     is the naming server (service registry), in case we want to call other services 
	 that just use the service name instead IP addresses / port  of micro services.
	 
- [VoucherCodeGeneratorApp] -  A mock service of 3rd party to return the voucher code.
     this is a simple micro service acts as a voucher code generator; each voucher has 
	 an id and code. To make it simple I have created several voucher codes by hard 
	 code in the service.
	 
- [development-challenge-gateway] - A gateway is a single entry point into the system, 
	 it means all calls to the system must go through this service or handle requests 
	 by routing them to the corresponding service.
	 
- [PurchasePrepaidDataApp] -   API service to integrate with 3rd parties, handle 
	request from front end, stored data to DB and return voucher code.
